# Theme Settings Moved to Settings Modal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed ThemeToggle Component from Header
- **Removed import** of `ThemeToggle` from `App.tsx`
- **Removed ThemeToggle button** from mobile header
- **Removed ThemeToggle button** from desktop header
- Header is now cleaner with one less button

### 2. Added Theme Selection to Settings Modal

**Updated `UserSettings.tsx`:**
- Added theme state: `'light' | 'dark' | 'system'`
- Added icons: `Sun`, `Moon`, `Monitor`
- Created `handleThemeChange()` function that:
  - Updates theme state
  - Saves to localStorage
  - Applies theme immediately to document

**New UI Section:**
- Three-button grid layout for theme selection
- Each button shows:
  - Icon (Sun for Light, Moon for Dark, Monitor for System)
  - Label text
  - Selected state with purple border and background
- Placed at top of settings modal (before email preferences)
- Help text: "Choose your preferred color theme or use your system settings"

### 3. Updated Modal Title
Changed from "Email Notification Settings" to just "Settings" since it now handles multiple settings types.

## User Experience

**Before:**
- Theme toggle button in header (sun/moon icon)
- Separate settings button for notifications

**After:**
- Single settings button in header (gear icon)
- Settings modal contains:
  1. Theme preference (top)
  2. Email notification preferences (bottom)

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner header with fewer buttons
- All user preferences in one place
- Theme changes are instant and visual
- More organized settings experience

## Technical Details

### Theme Persistence
- Theme preference stored in `localStorage` with key `'theme'`
- Loads on modal open
- Applies immediately on selection
- Works with existing `useTheme()` hook for system preference detection

### Theme Options
1. **Light** - Force light mode
2. **Dark** - Force dark mode  
3. **System** - Follow system preference (default)

### Styling
- Selected theme has purple border (`border-purple-500`)
- Selected theme has purple background (`bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20`)
- Unselected themes have gray border with hover effect
- Icons are color-coded:
  - Light: Amber (`text-amber-600`)
  - Dark: Blue (`text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400`)
  - System: Gray (`text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`)

## Files Changed
