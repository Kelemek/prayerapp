## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1️⃣ Set Up GitHub Secrets (Required)

Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these 4 secrets:

| Secret Name | Where to Find It |
|-------------|------------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | The part before `.supabase.co` in your URL |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role key |

### 2️⃣ Enable Workflow Permissions

Go to Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
- Select **"Read and write permissions"**
- Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
- Click **Save**

### 3️⃣ Test the Backup

**Option A: Trigger via GitHub UI**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Daily Database Backup"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
4. Wait for completion
5. Check the `backups/` folder for new files

**Option B: Run locally**
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.backup.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run backup
./scripts/backup-database.sh
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

```bash
ls -lht backups/ | head -10
```

```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- ✅ Keep repository **PRIVATE** - backups contain your data
- ✅ Never commit `.env` file - it's already in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Secrets are encrypted in GitHub - safe for storage
- ✅ Limit repository access to trusted users only

### Storage
- Each backup is ~few MB compressed (depends on data size)
- 30 backups ≈ 30-100 MB typically
- GitHub free tier: 500 MB storage included
- Consider upgrading if you have large databases

### Costs
- GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/month free (this uses ~5 min/day)
- Supabase: Database backups don't count against your quota
- Total cost: **FREE** for most use cases

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Backup Fails
1. Check GitHub secrets are set correctly
2. Verify database password hasn't changed
3. Review workflow logs in Actions tab

### Can't Restore
1. Make sure PostgreSQL client is installed
2. Check `.env` file has correct credentials
3. Verify backup file isn't corrupted: `gzip -t backup.sql.gz`

### Workflow Doesn't Run
1. Check Actions are enabled in repository settings
2. Verify workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"
3. Check cron schedule (times are in UTC)

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your database is now protected with automated daily backups. The system will:
1. ✅ Run automatically every day
2. ✅ Keep your last 30 backups
3. ✅ Verify backup integrity weekly
4. ✅ Store backups safely in your repository

**Don't forget to:**
- [ ] Add the 4 GitHub secrets
- [ ] Enable workflow permissions
- [ ] Run a test backup
- [ ] Verify backup appears in `backups/` folder
