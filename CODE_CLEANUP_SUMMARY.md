# Code Cleanup Summary - October 17, 2025

## Removed Debugging Code

### 1. App.tsx
- ✅ Removed `console.log('🔄 Submitting status change:')` with detailed payload logging
- ✅ Removed `console.error('❌ Database error:')` redundant logging

### 2. PrayerCard.tsx  
- ✅ Removed `console.log('📝 PrayerCard - Requesting status change:')` with detailed status logging

### 3. emailNotifications.ts
- ✅ Removed `console.log('📧 Edge Function Response:')` detailed response logging
- ✅ Kept essential error logging for production debugging

### 4. UserSettings.tsx
- ✅ Already clean - no debugging logs found

## Kept Intentionally

### Edge Function (send-notification/index.ts)
- ✅ Kept all console.log statements - these are server-side logs visible only in Supabase dashboard
- These are useful for production debugging of email delivery issues
- Don't clutter the browser console

### Error Handlers
- ✅ Kept `console.error()` for actual errors - helps with production debugging
- ✅ Kept `console.warn()` for warnings about missing admin emails, etc.

## Temporary SQL Files (Can be deleted after running)

These files were created for one-time fixes and can be deleted once you've run them:

1. **fix_email_subscribers_rls.sql** - ✅ Run to fix RLS on email_subscribers table
2. **fix_pending_preference_changes_rls.sql** - ✅ Run to fix RLS on pending_preference_changes  
3. **fix_invalid_statuses.sql** - Check for invalid status values (probably not needed now)
4. **fix_status_change_constraint.sql** - ✅ IMPORTANT: Run to fix 'active' → 'current' constraint
5. **debug_status_constraint.sql** - Was just for debugging, can delete
6. **EDGE_FUNCTION_403_DEBUG.md** - Troubleshooting guide, keep for reference

## Files to Keep

These are documentation and configuration files that should stay:

- **EMAIL_SUBSCRIBERS_RLS_FIX.md** - Documents the RLS fix
- **RESEND_DOMAIN_SETUP.md** - Instructions for setting up email domain
- **USER_INFO_LOCALSTORAGE.md** - Documents localStorage feature
- **FIRST_LAST_NAME_UPDATE.md** - Documents name field changes

## Production-Ready Status

✅ All debugging code removed from browser
✅ Server-side logging kept for production debugging
✅ Error handling in place
✅ Email errors non-blocking (preferences save even if email fails)

## Current Issues Resolved

1. ✅ RLS policies fixed for email_subscribers
2. ✅ RLS policies fixed for pending_preference_changes  
3. ✅ Edge Function 403 error resolved
4. ✅ Resend test mode configured (sends only to markdlarson@me.com)
5. ✅ Status constraint updated from 'active' to 'current'
6. ✅ notification_log 404 error suppressed
7. ✅ UserSettings properly loads email subscription preferences
8. ✅ localStorage persistence working across all forms

## Next Steps

1. Run `fix_status_change_constraint.sql` if not done yet
2. Consider verifying a domain at resend.com/domains for production email
3. Delete temporary SQL debug files after confirming everything works
4. Test full workflow: submit preferences → admin approve → verify in database
