# Email Notification Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Email Settings Component (`src/components/EmailSettings.tsx`)
A new admin interface component that allows administrators to:
- Add/remove admin email addresses
- View the list of configured emails
- Save email notification settings to the database
- Validate email format before adding
- Display success/error messages

### 2. Database Table (`supabase/migrations/create_admin_settings.sql`)
Created an `admin_settings` table to store:
- Notification email addresses (array of emails)
- Timestamps for tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for authenticated users
- Single-row constraint (singleton pattern)

### 3. Email Notification System (`src/lib/emailNotifications.ts`)
Created a notification utility that:
- Sends notifications when new prayers or updates are submitted
- Retrieves admin email list from database
- Generates HTML and plain-text email content
- Provides placeholder for email service integration
- Includes professional email templates with branding

### 4. Integration Points

#### Admin Portal (`src/components/AdminPortal.tsx`)
- Added `EmailSettings` component to the Settings tab
- Placed above the Password Change component
- Accessible via the Settings button in admin navigation

#### Prayer Manager (`src/hooks/usePrayerManager.ts`)
- Integrated email notifications when new prayers are submitted
- Integrated email notifications when prayer updates are added
- Non-blocking async calls (failures don't break prayer submission)

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. Admin logs into Admin Portal
2. Navigates to Settings tab
3. Adds admin email addresses
4. Clicks Save Settings

### Notification Flow:
1. User submits new prayer request or update
2. Data is saved to database with "pending" status
3. `sendAdminNotification()` is called automatically
4. Function retrieves admin emails from database
5. Email notification is prepared with prayer/update details
6. (After email service setup) Email is sent to all configured admins
7. Admins receive email with link to Admin Portal
8. Admin reviews and approves/denies the submission

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed:
- Email settings UI with add/remove functionality
- Database schema for storing email addresses
- Email notification framework
- Integration with prayer submission flow
- HTML email templates
- Comprehensive documentation

### ðŸ”§ Requires Setup:
- Email service configuration (Supabase Edge Function or third-party API)
- Environment variables for email service
- Database migration deployment
- Email service API credentials

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Choose Email Service:**
   - Recommended: Resend, SendGrid, or AWS SES
   - Set up account and get API credentials

3. **Implement Email Sending:**
   - Option A: Create Supabase Edge Function (see EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md)
   - Option B: Direct API integration (see EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md)

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_URL=your_service_url
   VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

5. **Test:**
   - Add test email in Settings
   - Submit prayer request
   - Verify email received

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/components/EmailSettings.tsx` - Email management UI
- `src/lib/emailNotifications.ts` - Notification system
- `supabase/migrations/create_admin_settings.sql` - Database schema
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Setup documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/AdminPortal.tsx` - Added EmailSettings import and component
- `src/hooks/usePrayerManager.ts` - Added notification triggers

## Email Template Features

The notification emails include:
- Branded header with gradient background
- Prayer/update title and details
- Requester/author information
- Direct link to Admin Portal
- Responsive design
- Professional styling
- Clear call-to-action button

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses stored in protected database table
- RLS policies require authentication
- Email sending happens server-side (Edge Functions)
- No sensitive data exposed in emails
- Admin-only access to settings

## Notes

- Email notifications are non-blocking (won't break app if they fail)
- Console logs show notification attempts for debugging
- Email service integration is intentionally left as a placeholder
- Multiple email service options supported
- Easy to extend with additional notification types

## Support

- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Detailed setup guide
- Console logs for debugging
- Supabase documentation for Edge Functions
- Email service provider documentation
