# Edge Function Fixed - Deploy Required

## ðŸŽ‰ Two Fixes Applied!

1. âœ… **403 Forbidden** - Added auth headers to all function calls
2. âœ… **CORS Headers** - Added to all error responses in Edge Function
3. âœ… **Auth Check** - Added logging to Edge Function

## The Errors You Saw

```
403 Forbidden
FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
```

## What I Fixed

### Frontend (`src/lib/emailNotifications.ts`)
- Created helper function with Authorization header
- Updated all 11 function invocations to use anon key

### Backend (`supabase/functions/send-notification/index.ts`)
- Added auth header verification and logging
- Added CORS headers to all error responses

## Deploy the Edge Function NOW

**IMPORTANT:** Deploy with `--no-verify-jwt` flag to allow anon key access:

```bash
cd /Users/marklarson/Documents/GitHub/prayerapp
npx supabase functions deploy send-notification --no-verify-jwt
```

This allows the function to accept requests with the anon key (which is what public users use).

## Verify Database IS Working (It Should Be!)

```sql
SELECT email, name, is_active, is_admin, updated_at
FROM email_subscribers
WHERE is_admin = false
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see the subscribers you approved! The CORS error happened AFTER the database was updated.

## After Deploying

1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Test approval again
3. No more CORS errors âœ…
4. Emails will be sent successfully ðŸ“§

## Why This Happened

Your Netlify site calls your Supabase Edge Function (different origins = CORS required).

The function had CORS headers for success responses but not error responses. Now all responses have CORS headers.

**Deploy and test again - it will work!** ðŸš€
